What is gRPC?

gRPC is a modern, open source remote procedure call (RPC) framework that can run anywhere. It enables client and server applications to communicate transparently, and makes it easier to build connected systems.

Read the longer Motivation & Design Principles post for background on why we created gRPC.
What does gRPC stand for?

gRPC Remote Procedure Calls, of course!
Why would I want to use gRPC?

The main usage scenarios:

    Low latency, highly scalable, distributed systems.
    Developing mobile clients which are communicating to a cloud server.
    Designing a new protocol that needs to be accurate, efficient and language independent.
    Layered design to enable extension eg. authentication, load balancing, logging and monitoring etc.

Who’s using this and why?

gRPC is a CNCF project.

Google has been using a lot of the underlying technologies and concepts in gRPC for a long time. The current implementation is being used in several of Google’s cloud products and Google externally facing APIs. It is also being used by Square, Netflix, CoreOS, Docker, Cockroachdb, Cisco, Juniper Networks and many other organizations and individuals.
