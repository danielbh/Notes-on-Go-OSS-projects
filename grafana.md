Especially because the majority of it is written in typescript. Additionally Grafana is a very popular project with a lot of companies using it as a dashboard.

This looks like a good first issue to check out: https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/13924

*Update* Someone solved this with an MR: https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/14110. Looks like it was an easy one should have just gone for it. There will be others.

This will require a quick review of oauth and some other research: 

- [x] https://oauth.net/2/
- [ ] https://github.com/golang/oauth2
- [ ] https://medium.com/@darutk/diagrams-and-movies-of-all-the-oauth-2-0-flows-194f3c3ade85

configure oauth for grafana to test: http://docs.grafana.org/auth/google/
